Project Title: ZERO WASTE

Selected Domain: Web development

Problem Statement: “ZeroWaste – AI Powered Geo-Intelligent Food Donation & Rescue System”

Our Solution:
ZeroWaste is geo-intelligent food donation and rescue system designed to bridge the gap between donors and receivers. The platform empowers food donors (restaurants, individuals, businesses) to easily list excess food items with automatic location tagging. Meanwhile, receivers (e.g., NGOs, shelters, community kitchens) can browse available donations in real-time on an interactive map, request items nearby, and track the donation lifecycle from request to verification.

Features for Donors:
Create and manage food donations with geolocation
View and approve/reject donation requests
Track donation status from “Pending” → “Accepted” → “Picked” → “Verified”

Features for Receivers:
Browse nearby available donations using a dynamic Leaflet map
Request donations with a single click
Track requested donations and mark them as picked

Additional Highlights:
Clean UI with intuitive dashboards for both roles
Firebase for real-time database and authentication
Built using React for frontend, Leaflet for maps, and Firestore as a backend as a service for a fully dynamic experience
Custom status-based UI flows with role-specific actions
ZeroWaste not only promotes sustainability and reduces food waste but also helps local communities access surplus food with dignity and ease.
